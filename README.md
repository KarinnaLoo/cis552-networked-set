For our final project we built a networked version of the game Set. We completed single player and two-player versions of the game. The main components of our project include:

Logic.hs: contains all the game logic and parsing functions
Main.hs: that sets up the networking (for two-player only) and concurrency
MultiplayerGame.hs/SinglePlayerGame.hs: contains the main game loops
Test modules:
Tests.hs: contains unit and QuickCheck tests for individual game logic functions
TestSinglePlayer.hs: simply runs a single player game to completion
TestClient.hs: is a client that will connect to a server and automatically play the game, printing the game state to the console as well as running validation tests after every turn.

We didnâ€™t use any external libraries, but we did use the Parser.hs and ParserCombinators.hs files from class.
